# 🛠️ AI-Powered Car Defect Detection System using YOLOv7 & CNN

## 📌 Overview

Ensuring vehicle quality before sale is a critical requirement in automotive manufacturing. Surface defects like scratches, dirt, and paint overflow not only affect aesthetics but can also compromise overall performance. Traditional manual inspections are time-consuming, subjective, and error-prone.

This project introduces a fully automated image-based **defect detection system** that uses:
- **YOLOv7** for real-time defect localization
- **CNNs** for precise defect classification

By automating the inspection process, the system significantly reduces labor costs, inspection time, and inconsistency — improving accuracy and boosting customer satisfaction.
